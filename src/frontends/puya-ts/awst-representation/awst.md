# Acquiring AWST representation

In order for puya-ts to be able to use its expression builders to generate a valid [`AWST`](../../../backend/AWST/AWST.md) that may go through the compiler pipeline, it first needs to be able to represent its structure (nodes and [`wtypes`](../../../backend/AWST/typesystem/wtypes.md)) internally.

<!-- TODO: talk about autogenerated nodes.ts -->
<!-- TODO: talk about the wtypes representation in wtypes.ts -->
